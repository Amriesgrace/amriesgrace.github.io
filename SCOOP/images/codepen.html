                              I was always interested in cooking as a kid. Accoring to mother i started cooking at the age of eight . Cooking is a part of my 
                              culture so i didn't think anything special of my love for cooking. It was the house chore i preferred to washing dishes.

                              At age 15 i was cooking meals for the family and my favorite things in the kitchen were the sharp knives.
                              I gained admission to the university to study Computer science and at this time i had no idea that culinary schools existed. 
                              I came across Ramsay's Ultimate home cookery on youtube. I loved and that marked the beginning of an unwavering love for 
                              all things gordon ramsay.
                              I watched all Ramsay shows and videos. He became a mentor after reading his book Humble Pie. I was able to connect on another level because i could relate to the same type of upbringing, surroundings and abuse.
                              I went on to research culinary schools they are all very expensive. I am very passionate about  food and cooking. 
                              I have a dream to attend culinary school and  to be a protege to Gordon Ramsay.
                              I also hope to own a fine dinig resturant one day. Until then Programming and home cooking is my outlet to creativity. 
                              I am a dreamer but dreams become reality. I hope mine does.
